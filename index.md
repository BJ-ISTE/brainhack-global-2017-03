# Frequently asked questions:

### What is a hackathon?

A hackathon is a (usually) short, intense burst of collaborative activity
focused on project work (usually in groups) on a particular topic. In this case, we will work together on neuroscience topics.

### When you say neuroscience, you mean computational neuroscience/neuroimaging/electrophysiology/choose-your-favorite-subfield?

No. If you want to hack on *any* neuroscience-related question, we would be happy for you to participate.  

### So I need to know a lot in advance?

No! Come as you are. If you are interested in learning new things, this an great
environment to do so. Depending on your interests, we might set up some
tutorials about a few neuroscience and data science topics, so you can learn the
things you need to know to make the most out of Brainhack Global.

### But I need to have some data or question?

No! Even if you don't have a project in mind, you should come and join forces
with others. One of the goals of the event is to meet other members of the
neuroscience and data science communities on UW campus and in Seattle.


### Is it fun?

Why would we otherwise do it?
