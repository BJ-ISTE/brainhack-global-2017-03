# Frequently asked questions:

### What is a hackathon?

A hackathon is a (usually) short, intense burst of collaborative activity
focused on project work (usually in groups) on a particular topic. In this case, we will work together on neuroscience topics.

### When you say neuroscience, you mean computational-neuroscience/neuroimaging/electrophysiology/choose-your-favorite-subfield?

No. If you want to hack on *anything* neuroscience-related, we would be happy for you to participate in this.  

### So I need to know a lot in advance?

No! Come as you are. If you are interested in learning new things, this an great
environment to do so. Depending on your interests, we might set up some
tutorials about a few neuroscience and data science topics, so you can learn the
things you need to know to make the most out of Brainhack Global.

### But I need to have some data or question?

No! Even if you don't have a project in mind, you should come and join forces
with others. One of the goals of the event is to meet other members of the
neuroscience and data science communities on the UW campus and in Seattle.

### Do I need a computer?

Yes - if you have a laptop computer, please bring it with you. If you do not
have a computer, please let [Ariel](http://arokem.org) (email address within)
know in advance.

### Can I help?

If you want to teach a tutorial about some topic, or you are interested in
giving a short talk about your research, we would welcome that. If we have
enough interest in presenting, we will organize a data-blitz on Saturday
afternoon (short, 1-slide, 5-minute presentations).

### Is it fun?

Yes! Of course it is.
